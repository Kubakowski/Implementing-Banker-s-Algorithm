Bankers_Algorithm.cpp will read in a list of values from a file into three, 2-dimensional arrays named "Alloc","Max",and "Avail". When complete, the input file is closed. Banker's Algorithm is then performed using the arrays as matrices. When completed, if the state is found to be safe, then the safe sequence will be output to the console.

See documentation.txt for information on how to compile and run the program.
